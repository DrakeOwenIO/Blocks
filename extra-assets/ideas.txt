1. Game where you have a bunch of shapes on the screen, like 5 to start.
    Maybe you have 2 circle, 1 triangle, and  2 squares. 
    Stuff like that. You have control of all of these shapes. 
    You can move them up down and around the screen. 
    Different shapes will move at different speeds.
    There's no physics so they just slide around the screen.  
    Then, obstacles start coming at you from the right.

    Objective: Fit through these walls and obstacles and stay on the screen
            as long as possible. The more shapes you have at the end of the round,
            the higher your score will be. Inspiration was "block party" from fall guys.

    Styling: Neons shapes with black background. 

    Find screen width, then set main container to that size dynimcailly so the game with be contained with the screen
    Maybe add a bit of padding.

    Future Idea: Add physics, rag dolling, all of that.
