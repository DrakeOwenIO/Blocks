1. Game where you have a bunch of shapes on the screen, like 5 to start.
    Maybe you have 2 circle, 1 triangle, and  2 squares. 
    Stuff like that. You have control of all of these shapes. 
    You can move them up down and around the screen. 
    Different shapes will move at different speeds.
    There's no physics so they just slide around the screen.  
    Then, obstacles start coming at you from the right.

    Objective: Fit through these walls and obstacles and stay on the screen
            as long as possible. The more shapes you have at the end of the round,
            the higher your score will be. Inspiration was "block party" from fall guys.

    Styling: Neons shapes with black background. 

    Find screen width, then set main container to that size dynimcailly so the game with be contained with the screen
    Maybe add a bit of padding.

    Future Idea: Add physics, rag dolling, all of that.



2. Moving maze. Generate a maze of a certain height and width. 
        it moves and you'r time survived is the score. 

        It will be level based so that I dont have to do procedural generation.



3. Obstacles flying at the player
        Every second generate a new blue retangle to slide across the screen. 
        Choose a random y value to spawn at, random width, and speed
        Create an enemy spawn timer to time that
        Create another timer to increase difficulty every 30 seconds or so
        Create a score timer to record how long the game lasts

        Deconstruct the object after its off the screen (have to create a Deconstructor for our obstacle class)
